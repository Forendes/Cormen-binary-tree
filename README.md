# Cormen-binary-tree-rust
Rust implementation of binary tree from the book "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition"

# Overview
I'm going through the book and implementing basic algorithms/data structures in Rust to get a better understanding of the language and these CS concepts. This implementation assumes that tree always exists and root can't be empty.
